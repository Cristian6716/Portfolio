I've developed a visualization with **tableau** that allows the client to track how the services offered impact product sales. The first page analyzes the impact on sales, the second page analyzes the impact on revenue, while the third provides a summary table.

During my master's studies, I developed a project analyzing the performance of the Superstore. In the Overview section, I conducted an analysis on the overall sales trends. In the Performance section, I performed an analysis showcasing the performance of various nations where the Superstore operates, as well as sub-categories of products sold. This enables us to provide valuable insights for both marketing campaigns and decisions regarding budget allocation across different locations or products.
